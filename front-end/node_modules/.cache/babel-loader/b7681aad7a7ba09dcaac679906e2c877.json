The NYC Department of Health estimates approximately\n            3,000 people die each year due to PM2.5-related illnesses in the\n            city, and approximately 8,000 more hospital visits can be linked to\n            dangerous PM2.5 exposure.\n            <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/eode/eode-air-quality-impact.pdf\">\n              Maps\n            </a>\n            from a study by the Department of Health show that the distribution\n            of PM2.5-related medical incidents is not even across neighborhoods,\n            and is elevated with higher poverty rates. This shows that\n            particulate matter air pollution is a community-based problem, that\n            may have a community-based solution.

Some research\n            into this correlation has been done, but neither in NYC residential\n            settings, nor through a citizen-based initiative. SONYC is in a\n            unique position to leverage existing sound-collecting apparatus and\n            community relationships towards examining this correlation. More\n            data regarding this correlation may lead to better understandings of\n            links between air or noise pollution and certain health conditions,\n            and can help city agencies and community groups to better devote\n            resources to neighborhoods with pollution problems. <br />\n            <br />\n            Additionally, SONYC's existing app for delivering sound data to\n            residents in real time and requesting their qualitative analysis of\n            sound quality can be modified to perform the same functions with air\n            quality. AQ data processed by the new code can be delivered into the\n            app and presented in real time, in a manner suitable for a\n            non-specialist audience. It can also be used as a means for\n            collecting qualitative data, allowing us to link quantitative\n            analysis with qualitative feedback.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n        </div>\n        <br /> <br />\n        <div className=\"block\">\n          <h4 className=\"gif-text\">Data Formatting Information </h4>\n          <h5 className=\"gif-text-h5\">Output String Information </h5>\n          <p className=\"full-text\">\n            Output information from the IPS is delivered to the Pi as a string.\n            This string contains the particle count and particle mass for the\n            particle sizes measured by the sensor (PM0.1, PM0.3, PM0.5, PM1.0,\n            PM2.5, PM5.0, and PM10) in the units the sensor is set to.
